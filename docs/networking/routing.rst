Ted Stevens once referred to the internet as a "Series of Tubes" which while amusing to hear is actually not a bad way to term it. Routing is the process used to figure out which "tubes"(interfaces) information takes to get the intended destination.

Network devices have multiple ways of performing routing. There are static routes in which an engineer manually creates a statement which says "use this interface or IP address to get to the destination I want", and there is dynamic routing that allows routers to talk to each other and exchange the information they have on destinations and how to get to them. 

Routers, they use somethign called routing table to keep track of
